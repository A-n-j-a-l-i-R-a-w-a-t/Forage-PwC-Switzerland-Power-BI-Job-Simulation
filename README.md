## Overview

In this simulation, I was tasked with creating three Power BI dashboards to address specific client needs related to data visualization and analysis. The focus areas included customer service metrics, retention strategies, and diversity and inclusion in hiring practices.

## Dashboards Created

### 1. Call Centre Trends
- **Description**: This dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to call center operations, including customer satisfaction, call metrics, and agent performance.
- **Key KPIs**:
  - Overall customer satisfaction
  - Overall calls answered/abandoned
  - Average speed of answer
  - Calls by time
  - Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
